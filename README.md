# Star Wars API

# Task

For this exercise, you’ll be using the publicly available Star Wars API (https://swapi.co/) and the
endpoint that allows you to query for Star Wars characters. (/people endpoint:
https://swapi.co/documentation#people).

Your task is to build a web page that displays Star War characters in a table, using pagination. It
should also allow the user to search for a specific character by name (powered by the API’s
search parameter). This is the end goal but you’re obviously encouraged to make the UX as
compelling as possible!

# Resources
* [pagination](https://pagination.js.org/)

# Approach
* JS
  * vanilla js as using a framework was overkill.
* BootStrap 4
  * for out of the box features such as styling and responsiveness.

# Instructions
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will start the server.

# May the Force be with you
